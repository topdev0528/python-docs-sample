# How to become a contributor and submit your own code

## Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your sample apps and patches! However, before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement.

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html).
  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work the GoogleCloudPlatform organization, then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html).

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll add you to the official list of contributors and be able to accept your pull requests.

## Submitting Patches

1. Sign a Contributor License Agreement.
1. Coordinate your plans with team members that are listed on the repo in question. This ensures that work isn't being duplicated and communicating your plan early also generally leads to better patches.
1. Fork the desired repo, make and test your changes
1. Ensure that your code adheres to the existing style in the sample to which you are contributing. Refer to the [Google Cloud Platform Samples Style Guide](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/Home/wiki/STYLE.html) for the recommended coding standards for this organization. In the event the existing style conflicts with the recommended style, the former takes precedence over the latter.
1. Ensure that your code has an appropriate set of unit tests, which you have executed.
1. Submit a pull request. A pull request should address one issue in the repo. Please don't mix more than one logical change per pull request, because it makes the history hard to follow.

## Submitting a new sample app

Same procedure as for submitting patches, but with the additional provisions:

1. Request creation of a boilerplate repo in the GoogleCloudPlatform organization.
1. One of the organization owners will create a public repo for you with a default copy of README.md, LICENSE.md, and CONTRIB.md files from this project.
1. Proceed with submitting your code via the steps above for submitting a patch.
