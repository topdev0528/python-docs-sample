This directory contains samples for Google Cloud Composer. `Google Cloud Composer`_ is a managed Apache Airflow service that helps you create, schedule, monitor and manage workflows. Cloud Composer automation helps you create Airflow environments quickly and use Airflow-native tools, such as the powerful Airflow web interface and command line tools, so you can focus on your workflows and not your infrastructure.

To run this sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python copy_environment.py

    usage: copy_environment.py [-h] [--running_as_service_account]

                               [--override_network OVERRIDE_NETWORK]
                               [--override_subnetwork OVERRIDE_SUBNETWORK]
                               project location existing_env_name new_env_name

    Clone a composer environment.

    positional arguments:
      project               Google Cloud Project containing existing Composer
