# Google Cloud Speech API Samples

These samples show how to use the [Google Cloud Speech API][speech-api]
to transcribe audio files, as well as live audio from your computer's
microphone.

* [`api-client/`](api-client) contains samples that use the [Google API Client
  Library for Python][rest-client] to make REST calls to the API.
* [`grpc/`](grpc) contains samples that use the more-efficient (though sometimes
  more complex) [GRPC][grpc] API. The GRPC API also allows streaming requests.
